Play music by moving in front of your webcamera

**Note: so far works on Windows only**

Simply run the *webcam_beeper.py* and a window with video from the web-camera will pop-up.
The code runs background detection algorithm and the pitch of the beep signal changes 
depending on the part of the screen being regarded as a foreground.

To close the window, press Esc.

The code is not doing much, just beeping, so any improvements are welcome, let's jam :)
